# Evaluating-the-Effectiveness-of-an-Online-Health-Food-Store-s-Recommendation-System
*The Analysis of A/B Test Data*

## Overview
This project involves the analysis of an A/B experiment conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of a new recommendation system for an online health food store. The goal is to determine if the new recommendation system leads to an increase in revenue compared to the existing system.

## Background
The online store has implemented a new recommendation system based on neural networks, which suggests relevant products to users based on their past purchases and the purchases of other users. An A/B experiment was conducted to compare the new system with the existing one. The experiment ran from October 1, 2023, to October 14, 2023.

## Data
The data used in this project includes:  
•	General user information (*user.csv*);  
•	Information about which group each user belonged to within the experiment (*user_ab_group.csv*);  
•	General information about shop goods (*good.csv*);  
•	User purchase history (*user_purchase.csv*);  
•	Information about purchased goods (*purchase_good.csv*)  

## Analysis
The analysis involves:  
•	Verifying that the groups are similar in terms of key demographics characteristics.  
•	Defining key metrics.  
•	Statistical tests (t-tests, chi-square tests, Welch’s t-test).  
•	Comparison of revenue metrics between the control and experimental groups.  

## Conclusion
The analysis concluded that the new recommendation system had a significant impact on user revenue metrics, suggesting its effectiveness over the existing system.
